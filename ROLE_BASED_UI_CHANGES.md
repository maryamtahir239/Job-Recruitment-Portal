# Role-Based UI Changes

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to implement separate sidebars and navbars for different user roles (SuperAdmin, HR, and Interviewer) in the Job Recruitment Portal.

## Changes Made

### 1. Role-Based Menu Configuration (`src/mocks/data.js`)
- **SuperAdmin Menu**: Dashboard, HR & Interviewer Management, Job Postings, Candidates, Applications
- **HR Menu**: Dashboard, Job Postings, Candidates, Applications, Evaluated Candidates
- **Interviewer Menu**: Dashboard, Evaluation Form, Evaluated Candidates

### 2. Role-Based Sidebar (`src/components/partials/sidebar/index.jsx`)
- Modified to use role-based menu items
- Uses `useRoleBasedMenu` hook to dynamically load appropriate menu based on user role
- Automatically updates when user role changes

### 3. Role-Based Mobile Menu (`src/components/partials/sidebar/MobileMenu.jsx`)
- Updated to use role-based menu items
- Consistent with main sidebar functionality

### 4. Role-Based Horizontal Menu (`src/components/partials/header/Tools/HorizentalMenu.jsx`)
- Updated to use role-based menu items for horizontal layout
- Filters out header items to show only menu items

### 5. Custom Hook (`src/hooks/useRoleBasedMenu.js`)
- Created to manage role-based menu state
- Automatically detects user role changes
- Provides reactive menu updates

### 6. Header Modifications (`src/components/partials/header/index.jsx`)
- **Removed**: Search box, Language selector, Settings icon, Message icon, Notification icon
- **Added**: Full portal name "Job Recruitment Portal" in both vertical and horizontal layouts
- **Kept**: Dark mode toggle and Profile dropdown

### 7. Sidebar Logo Updates (`src/components/partials/sidebar/Logo.jsx`)
- Updated to display "Job Recruitment Portal" instead of "JR Portal"
- Consistent branding across the application

### 8. Route Updates (`src/App.jsx`)
- Added missing routes for evaluation-form and evaluated-candidates
- Ensures all menu items have corresponding routes

## User Experience

### SuperAdmin
- Access to HR & Interviewer Management
- Full access to all job and candidate management features
- Can manage user roles and permissions

### HR
- Focus on job postings, candidates, and applications
- Access to evaluated candidates for review
- No access to user management

### Interviewer
- Focus on evaluation tasks
- Access to evaluation forms and evaluated candidates
- Limited to interview-related functions

## Technical Implementation

### Menu Structure
Each role has a dedicated menu configuration with:
- Header section (role-specific title)
- Navigation items with icons and links
- Proper routing to corresponding pages

### Dynamic Updates
- Menu automatically updates when user logs in/out
- Real-time role detection from localStorage
- Consistent across all UI components (sidebar, mobile menu, horizontal menu)

### Responsive Design
- Works on all screen sizes
- Mobile menu uses same role-based logic
- Horizontal menu adapts to role-based items

## Benefits
1. **Improved User Experience**: Users see only relevant menu items
2. **Better Security**: Role-based access control at UI level
3. **Cleaner Interface**: Removed unnecessary UI elements
4. **Consistent Branding**: Full portal name displayed throughout
5. **Maintainable Code**: Centralized role-based logic in custom hook

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Login as different user roles
2. Verify sidebar shows correct menu items
3. Check mobile menu functionality
4. Test horizontal layout (if enabled)
5. Verify all menu links work correctly
